# Location-Based Sound Walk App: Project Specification

## 1. Overview
The app plays sound clips based on the user's physical location. Users can choose from different "walks" or "stories," each consisting of sound files tagged with GPS coordinates and a radius. The app uses the phone's GPS to determine which sound to play.

## 2. Goals
- Provide an immersive, location-based audio experience.
- Allow users to select from multiple stories/walks.
- Eventually support both local and remote (server-based) sound file and story configuration.

## 3. Features
- **Location Tracking**: Use GPS to determine user's location.
- **Sound Playback**: Play sound clips based on location and selected story.
- **Story Selection**: Users can choose from available stories/walks.
- **Configuration Management**: Stories and sound files can be loaded from local files or a remote server.
- **Offline Support**: Initial support for local files, with future server sync.

## 4. Technical Requirements
- **Platform**: React Native (Expo)
- **Location**: Use Expo Location API
- **Audio**: Use Expo AV for sound playback
- **Data Storage**: Local JSON files for initial configuration, with future server API integration
- **Networking**: Fetch stories and sound files from a server (future)

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Smooth location updates and audio playback
- **Scalability**: Architecture should support future server integration
- **User Experience**: Intuitive UI for story selection and audio playback
