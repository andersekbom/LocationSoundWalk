# Location-Based Sound Walk App: Architecture

## 1. High-Level Overview
The app is built with React Native (Expo) and follows a client-server architecture for future scalability.

## 2. Client-Side Architecture
- **UI Layer**: Story selection, playback controls, and user feedback
- **Business Logic**: Location tracking, sound file selection, and playback
- **Data Layer**: Local JSON configuration and sound files, with API for remote data

## 3. Data Structure
- **Stories**: JSON files describing each story, including sound file references and GPS triggers
- **Sound Files**: Audio files stored locally or fetched from a server

## 4. Server-Side Architecture (Future)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/stories`: List available stories
  - `/story/{id}`: Get story configuration
  - `/sound/{id}`: Fetch sound file
- **Database**: Store story configurations and sound file metadata

## 5. Data Flow
1. User selects a story.
2. App loads story configuration (local or remote).
3. App monitors GPS location.
4. When user enters a trigger zone, the corresponding sound is played.

## 6. File Storage
- **Local**: JSON and sound files bundled with the app
- **Remote**: JSON and sound files hosted on a server, fetched as needed

## 7. Security
- HTTPS for all remote data transfers
- Local data validation to prevent malformed configurations
